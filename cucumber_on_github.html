  In order to read Cucumber features faster and eaiser on Github 
  As a Cucumber user
  I want to have syntax highlighting for Gherkin

  <span class="nc">Background:</span>
    <span class="k">Given</span> cheese is good

  <span class="nc">Scenario Outline:</span><span class="no"> this is a test </span>
    <span class="k">Given</span> I have a <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="ss">var1</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> and some <span class="s">&quot;string&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">And</span> the following table and some <span class="s">&#39;string&#39;</span>
      | header 1  | header 2  | <span class="c"># here is a comment after a table</span>
      | cell 1-1  | cell 1-2  |
      | cell 2-1  | <span class="s">&quot;cell 2-2&quot;</span>|

    <span class="k">When</span> I do <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="ss">var2</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
    <span class="k">And</span> here is a string with single and double quotes- <span class="s">&quot;i&#39;ll be back&quot;</span> 
    <span class="k">And</span> here is a string with the opposite <span class="s">&#39;the quote is &quot;Foo&quot;&#39;</span>
    <span class="k">And</span> what about a var in a quote like so: <span class="s">&quot;&lt;var2&gt;&quot;</span>

    <span class="k">Then</span> I should see something...
    <span class="k">But</span> not something else...

<span class="nc">  Examples:</span>
    |<span class="ss"> var1</span>  |<span class="ss">  var2</span>  |
    | foo   |  bar   |
    | dog   |  food  |

  <span class="nc">Scenario:</span><span class="no"> more examples</span>
    <span class="k">Given</span> some context<span class="c"># this is an inline comment</span>
    <span class="c"># This is a comment</span>
<span class="c"># So is this with no space at front...</span>

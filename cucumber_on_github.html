  <span class="nc">Scenario Outline:</span><span class="no"> this is a test </span>
<span class="no">                    this the second line of the desctiption</span>
<span class="no">    </span><span class="k">Given</span> I have a <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="ss">var1</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> and some <span class="s">&quot;string&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">And</span> the following table and some <span class="s">&#39;string&#39;</span>
      | header 1  | header 2  | <span class="c"># here is a comment after a table</span>
      | cell 1-1  | cell 1-2  |
      | cell 2-1  | <span class="s">&quot;cell 2-2&quot;</span>|

    <span class="k">When</span> I do <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="ss">var2</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
    <span class="k">And</span> here is a string with single and double quotes- <span class="s">&quot;i&#39;ll be back&quot;</span> 
    <span class="k">And</span> here is a string with the opposite <span class="s">&#39;the quote is &quot;Foo&quot;&#39;</span>
    <span class="k">And</span> what about a var in a quote like so: <span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="ss">var2</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="s">&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">And</span> what about a multiline string with a var in it like so:
    <span class="s">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="s">    Hello!</span>
<span class="s">    I am a multiple line string, often called a pystring.</span>
<span class="s">    I can have regular &quot;double quotes&quot; without a problem...</span>
<span class="s">    I can also sub in vars as well like: </span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="ss">var1</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="s"> and </span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="ss">var2</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="s"></span>
<span class="s">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="k">Then</span> I should see something...
    <span class="k">But</span> not something else...

  <span class="nc">Examples:</span>
    |<span class="ss"> var1</span>  |<span class="ss">  var2</span>  |

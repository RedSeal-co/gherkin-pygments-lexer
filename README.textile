h1. Gherkin Syntax Lexer for Pygments

This is a "pygments":http://pygments.org/ lexer for Gherkin- the language that "Cucumber":http://cukes.info knows.

h2. Installing

The lexer is part of the Pygments codebase. Pygments gets updated when there are major changes in this repo,
for example when a new translation is added to Gherkin.

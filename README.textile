This is a "pygments":http://pygments.org/ lexer for Gherkin- the language that "Cucumber":http://cukes.info knows.

For an idea of what it looks like "click here.":http://www.benmabey.com/cucumber_on_github.html

Once I am happy with it I will submit a patch to pygments so that Github will start syntax highlighting all *.feature files!

Please send me any suggestions you have on how to improve it.. Pull requests are even better. ;)

**TODO**
* Address having vars in strings.
* Generate keywords for all languages like we do in the TM bundle.
* Maybe color the headers for the step tables differently?
* Maybe highlight the narrative different?  Need to decide on a good token for that...

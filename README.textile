This is a "pygments":http://pygments.org/ lexer for Gherkin- the language that "Cucumber":http://cukes.info knows.

For an idea of what it looks like "click here.":http://www.benmabey.com/cucumber_on_github.html

Once I am happy with it I will submit a patch to pygments so that Github will start syntax highlighting all *.feature files!

Please send me any suggestions you have on how to improve it.. Pull requests are even better. ;)

**TODO**
* Highlight the table headers the same color as I am highlighting the vars in the brackets.
